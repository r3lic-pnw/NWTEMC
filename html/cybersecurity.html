      The cyber threat has become one of the most serious economic and national security challenges we face. America's
      competitiveness and economic prosperity in the 21st century will depend on effective cybersecurity. Every Internet
      user has a role to play in securing cyberspace and ensuring the safety of ourselves, our families, and our
      communities online.

      Tribal governments play a important role too in protecting its information and educating its members and employees
      about the risks when using computers, cell phones and other devices utilizing the internet.
