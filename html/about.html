        <h2>History</h2>
        <img src="../images/WA_HLS_Region_1_small_2.jpg"
          alt="Map of Tribes from Washington State Homeland Security Region 1">

        <p>
          The eight tribes of Washington State Homeland Security Region 1 formed the NW Tribal Emergency Management
          Council to address homeland security and emergency management issues each tribe faces.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Region I Homeland Security Tribes of Washington were at a severe disadvantage to address Emergency
          Management and Homeland Security Mandates and Initiatives due to lack of funded personnel to perform these
          functions. In addition to the lack of personnel to address the practical application of the needed scope of
          work, the Tribes were at a disadvantage to apply for grants for this very same reason. With the implementation
          of NIMS, the established implementation dates of many other related emergency management functions and the
          severe consequences that have been implemented for failure to comply; the Tribes continue to move toward
          creating a permanent solution. The creation of the Northwest Tribal Emergency Management Council is the first
          step toward addressing the many critical issues that face Washington State Tribes today.
        </p>

        <p>A solution was proposed to form a pilot project, the consortium of Tribes of Region 1.</p>

        <p>
          The Tribes of Region created a consortium of the eight Tribes for the purpose of Homeland Security to govern
          and oversee a needs assessment, develop a scope of work and propose deliverables. The Tulalip Tribes and the
          Lummi Nation, actively involved in the Region I Homeland Security Council since its inception, created many of
          the mandated documents, ordinances and programs required to pursue Homeland Security and Emergency Management.
          Through a proposed consortium of the eight Tribes in Region I, the Tulalip Tribes of Washington took the lead
          agency position for the purpose of administering of grants. The Lummi Nation and the Tulalip Tribes provided
          In-Kind Support toward this request. The request for funding primarily consisted of two phases. In Phase One,
          the funding request was that for two FTE positions to include one Homeland Security Manager and one Homeland
          Security Planner to come from '04 dollars. The Director was housed at the Lummi Nation. The Planner was housed
          at the Tulalip Tribes. The Manager and the Planner were governed by the NWTEMC and offered homeland security
          related services to all eight Tribes. These two newly created positions worked in concert with two existing
          positions, one at Tulalip and one at Lummi, whose primary functions were the application of Emergency
          Management related services. The Phase Two funding request came from '05 dollars and assisted in covering
          these same two FTE positions for the Homeland Security Manager and Planner. In-kind contributions and
          Alternative Resources continued to cover operational costs.
        </p>

        <p>
          The initial formation of a governance process involving a preliminary agreement reached with each of the
          Tribes was developed. This agreement now provides the Tribes with a complete understanding of the overall
          vision and the need for success. The forum developed as a result of these meetings and now provides the Tribal
          Governments with the ability to openly discuss all aspects of regional Homeland Security and Emergency
          Management related issues. More importantly, this Consortium has become the means by which establishing
          effective communication, mutual trust and allowing for consensus regarding further actions may occur.
        </p>

        <p>
          A formal Charter has been developed for the group. This document details the commitment of each Tribe to take
          the next step by establishing the designated representatives for the project by resolution. The Northwest
          Tribal Emergency Management Council (NWTEMC) has begun instituting the basic operational parameters for
          Homeland Security requirements and functional analysis while moving the project forward.
        </p>

        <p>
          The NWTEMC now addresses the needs for administrative and operational support, as well as oversight
          requirements for implementation of mutual technical projects. The NWTEMC also addresses associated
          administrative issues such as any Resolutions, Ordinances, Memorandum of Understandings, etc, as well as the
          establishment of a management infrastructure.
        </p>

        <p>
          The governance infrastructure includes basic rules under which the Council operates, including Robertâ€™s
          Revised Rules of Order. The Council has formed and operates through the establishment of a majority rule,
          one-agency one-vote participatory process that applies equally regardless of an agency's size or jurisdiction.
          This structure ensures that all voices are equally heard and all concerns are addressed.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Council also utilizes working groups from all levels of the represented agencies to address administrative
          functions, legal issues, logistical support, and technical development. The delegation of responsibilities
          among working groups reduces the requirement for the Council to deal with the day-to-day issues while
          maintaining their continued oversight.
        </p>

        <p>
          A substantial portion of the initial developmental effort for the project has focused on identifying Tribal
          Homeland Security issues, Tribal program preparedness and analysis and regional policy development. The NWTEMC
          members have initially been comprised of the WA State Region I Homeland Security Council Tribal
          representatives, however, has now expanded to include Tribes from throughout Washington State. This governing
          body has worked diligently to keep the focus of this group on emergency management and preparedness,
          discouraging the potential for this council to be redirected toward any other purpose.
        </p>

        <p>
          Twice a year, we hold a seminar to bring all of our partners together for the purpose of information sharing,
          education and systems building.
