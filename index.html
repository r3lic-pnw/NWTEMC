        </header>

        <div class="post-body">
          <p>
            NWTEMC is a 501(c)(3) Non-Profit Organization that was initially formed in 2004 as a consortium of Tribes in
            the Northwest region of Washington State to help Tribes participate in Homeland Security and Emergency
            Management preparedness efforts.
          </p>

          <p>
            Currently the NWTEMC is composed of and serves Tribes in Washington, Oregon Idaho and Alaska for the
            purposes
            of information sharing and solidarity in dealing with homeland security/emergency management/public health
            issues as they pertain to Native Nations.
          </p>

          <p>
            NWTEMC's Charter and other Incorporation-related documents can be found on our About page.
          </p>

          <p>
            Please look around our website. We are constantly updating and enhancing it, so if you would like to see
            something added please let us know. If you have training events, meetings or other events, we will be glad

            What separates NWTEMC and NTEMC from all other EM/HLS groups out there?
          </h3>

          <h4>The NWTEMC-NTEMC remains committed to Sovereign Immunity</h4>

          <p>
            Assisting our Tribal partners with building infrastructure and internal capacity. There are many groups out
            there that want to come into the Tribe and be the Incident Commanders, the Incident Management Team, and the
            First Responders. We want to continue to help our Tribal Nations remain in the driver’s seat of the their
            own incidents, and the best way that we can assure this is to continue our work in the areas of sharing
            information, training, skill sets, resources and best practices.
          </p>

          <h4>We believe that Public Safety and Public Health are Trust Responsibilities of the Federal Government</h4>

          <p>
            Therefore, we do not charge dues or membership fees to be a part of our organization. Although this makes
            sustainability difficult at times, we do not believe that our Tribal Nations should have to pay for what the
            Federal, State and Local Partners are receiving in the way of grants and technical assistance. Therefore, we
            continue to work hard on bringing grant dollars into the individual Tribal Nations, training opportunities
            to our Tribal Lands, and Technical Assistance to Indian Country that continues to help build our emergency
            management and homeland security programs, free of charge.
          </p>

          <h4>We are not a response organization. We believe very strongly in our mission:</h4>

          <p>

            To provide guidance and tools for member tribes to develop sustainable and all-hazard approaches to
            Emergency
            Management and Homeland Security, through an approach that emphasizes both inter and intra jurisdictional
            cooperation to maximize resources in mutual aid, training, exercises, planning, and equipping by sharing
            information and best practices.
          </p>

          <p>
            Because we are a very small non-profit, we have relied heavily on consortium grants, specific contract work
            that is provided at severely discounted rates for our member Tribes and the private sector. This year, the
            NWTEMC has partnered with Sourcewell (previously known as the National Joint Powers Alliance®), a national
            municipal contracting agency committed to serving our Members purchasing needs.
          </p>

          <p>
            We are both driven to provide efficient public service through contract purchasing solutions and other
            related
            programs. We are only able to do this as we work together, creating a unified purchasing alliance that is
            valued by both Sourcewell and the NWTEMC-NTEMC. We will now have access to more than 260 companies that have
            been vetted through this partnership.
